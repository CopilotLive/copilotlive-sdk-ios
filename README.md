## Requirements

- **iOS Version:** iOS 13+
- **Languages:** Swift, Objective-C
- **Package Managers:** SPM, CocoaPods

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate the Copilot SDK using **Swift Package Manager**:

1. Open your project in Xcode (version 11+ is required).
2. Go to Project Settings.
3. Select your project and navigate to the Package Dependencies tab.
4. Click the **+ button** to add a new package.
5. Enter the package URL:
   
   ```ruby
   https://github.com/CopilotLive/sdk-ios
   ```
   
6. Choose the desired version or branch and click **Add Package**.

### CocoaPods

To integrate the Copilot SDK using **CocoaPods**:

1. Add the following line to your `Podfile`:
   
   ```ruby
   pod 'CopilotSDK'
   ```
   
3. Run the command:
   
   ```bash
   pod install
   ```
   
3. Open the `.xcworkspace` file to start using the **SDK**.


## Permissions

The Copilot SDK requires certain permissions to enable core functionalities like voice interactions and seamless communication. Ensure the necessary permissions are granted in the appâ€™s `Info.plist` file.

#### Microphone Permission

To enable microphone access, update the `Info.plist` file by adding the following key:

```ruby
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for voice interactions.</string>
```

This permission is required to enable voice-based interactions, including making calls and using the assistant hands-free.

## Usage

### Initialization

To initialize the Copilot SDK, add the following code in your `AppDelegate` or at the start of your app lifecycle:

```swift
import CopilotSDK

func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
     // Override point for customization after application launch.
     initializeCopilotSDK()
     return true
}

func initializeCopilotSDK() {
     // Create a user object with placeholder data. Replace these values with real user data.
     let user = CopilotUser(
         fullName: "", // The full name of the user
         phoneNumber: "", // The user's phone number
         profileImageUrl: "", // URL for the user's profile image
         emailAddress: "", // The user's email address
         userIdentifier: "" // A unique identifier for the user
      )
        
      // Define appearance settings for the Copilot UI
      let appearance = CopilotAppearance(
          title: "Copilot Assistant", // Title displayed in the navigation bar
          backgroundColor: "#FFFFFF", // Background for the copilot view
          navigationBarTintColor: "#000000", // Tint for the navigation bar
          navigationBarBackgroundColor: "#FFFFFF" // Background for the navigation bar
      )
        
      // Create a configuration object with the token, user data, and appearance settings
      let config = CopilotConfig(
          token: "YOUR_COPILOT_TOKEN", // Replace with your actual Copilot token
          user: user, // Pass the user data
          appearance: appearance // Pass the appearance settings
      )
        
      // Initialize the Copilot SDK with the configuration
      Copilot.shared.initialize(with: config)
}

```

### User Management

```swift
let user = CopilotUser(
    fullName: "", // The full name of the user
    phoneNumber: "", // The user's phone number
    profileImageUrl: "", // URL for the user's profile image
    emailAddress: "", // The user's email address
    userIdentifier: "" // A unique identifier for the user
)
```

#### Setting the User in Copilot SDK
The Copilot SDK provides multiple ways to set the user for tracking and personalization purposes. You can choose the method that best fits your app's workflow:

##### 1. Set the User During Initialization
You can set the user directly when initializing the Copilot SDK. This is ideal when the user information is readily available at the time of app launch or SDK setup.

```swift   
Copilot.shared.initialize(
    with: CopilotConfig(
        user: user
    )
)
```

##### 2. Set the User After Initialization
If the user information becomes available later in the app lifecycle, you can set the user after the SDK has already been initialized.

```swift
Copilot.shared.setUser(user)
```
This method is useful when user details are fetched asynchronously, such as after a remote API call.

##### 3. Set the User on Login Success
When a user successfully logs into your app, you can notify the SDK to set the user. This ensures that the user's session is correctly tracked from the moment they log in.

```swift
Copilot.shared.notifyLoginSuccess(user)
```
This approach is particularly helpful in apps where user login is optional or delayed until a specific interaction.

#### Logging Out

To log out the current user:

```swift
Copilot.shared.logout()
```

### Customizing Appearance

To set a custom appearance:

```swift
let appearance = CopilotAppearance(
                      title: "Copilot Assistant", // Title displayed in the navigation bar
                      backgroundColor: "#FFFFFF", // Background for the copilot view
                      navigationBarTintColor: "#000000", // Tint for the navigation bar
                      navigationBarBackgroundColor: "#FFFFFF" // Background for the navigation bar
                 )
Copilot.shared.setAppearance(appearance)
```

### Conversations

#### Displaying Conversations

This feature enables users to interact with the Copilot assistant through a text-based conversation interface. Users can send and receive messages within the app, making it easy to communicate with the assistant for support, guided workflows, or general assistance. The conversation history is maintained, allowing users to resume past interactions seamlessly. This ensures a smooth and real-time messaging experience without switching between different platforms.

```swift
import UIKit

class MyViewController: UIViewController {

    func showConversation() {
        Copilot.shared.showConversations(on: self, initialMessage: "Hello!", delegate: self)
    }
}
```

#### Make a Call

This feature allows users to communicate with the Copilot assistant using voice instead of text. It is useful for hands-free interactions, accessibility needs, or situations where speaking is more convenient than typing. Users can initiate a real-time voice conversation within the app, making it easy to get assistance without manually typing queries. The call feature provides a seamless experience by enabling direct access to voice-based support without additional steps.

To enable this feature, ensure that microphone access is granted in `Info.plist`.

```swift
import UIKit

class MyViewController: UIViewController {

    func makeCall() {
        Copilot.shared.makeCall(on: self, delegate: self)
    }
}
```

#### Delegate Implementation

Conform to `CopilotDelegate` to handle conversation events:

```swift
extension MyViewController: CopilotDelegate {

    func didLoadConversation() {
        print("Conversations successfully loaded.")
        // Add additional logic, such as updating the UI or notifying the user
    }

    func didFailToLoadConversation(withError error: String) {
        print("Failed to load conversations: \(error)")
        // Displaying an error message
    }

    func didReceiveDeepLink(url: String) {
        print("Deep link received: \(url)")
        // Handle the deep link, such as navigating to a specific screen
    }
}
```
